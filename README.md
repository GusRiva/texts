# texts
This repository contains plain text versions of texts written in medieval French, deriving from critical editions believed to be out of copyright or known to be under Creative Commons licenses. They are published here with a [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). 

At present there is no order for the texts. File names are derivative of the [DEAFél](http://www.deaf-page.de/fr/bibl_neu.php) unique identifiers ('sigle') for editions. Metadata included in the file header are an expanded version of the 2006 recommendations of the Consortium pour les corpus de français médiéval [CCFM](http://ccfm.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?rubrique14).

The categories WebAuthor and WebReviewer in the metadata attempt to assign credit for the various tasks of the project. We use the [CASRAI Credit Typology](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Contributor_Roles) here. WebAuthor most closely maps to "Data Curation" and Web Reviewer to "Writing – Review & Editing".
